# MNIST-digit-recognition



we have used a CNN for classification of images from 0 to 9  ..
the model gives us a training accuracy of 98.98% whereas a tetsting accuracy of 98.08% thereby proving the
power of convolutional neural networks over dense stackof layers


i have uploaded the trained model for further use
